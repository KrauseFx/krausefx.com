In 2010 we visited the Google campus on our family trip to California. Ever since then I knew I wanted to work here at one point in my life. Today, 7 years later, I had my first day at Google in Mountain View, joining via the acquisition of Fabric. I'm so happy that I reached this goal, and I can't wait for what I'll learn over the next few months and years.
