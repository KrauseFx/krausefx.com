The U19 Freestyle Computing competition is organised by the Ars Electronica in Linz, Austria.

* 2011 I took part with my 
[Bikemap iPhone app](https://felix-krause-f13a.squarespace.com/blog/bikemap) and got one of the top 15 places.
* 2012 I sent in my 
[iPhone game iTanky](https://felix-krause-f13a.squarespace.com/blog/itanky) and landed in the top 15 places again. Both years there have been over 600 participants.
