You want to see how 
**Wikipedia**
, 
**Product Hunt**
, 
**MindNode**
 and 
**Artsy**
 are using 
fastlane to automate their iOS app submission process? 

The above companies were so nice to open source their 
fastlane setups. I collected them and put it on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/fastlane/examples).
