iTanky is a fun and addictive 2 dimensional tank game for iOS. You can either play the campaign or fight against your friends via Wifi or Bluetooth. I developed this app together with Richard, a your graphic designer from Dresden, Germany. I also developed a web based map editor that works on all modern browsers. This app is completely free available here:
