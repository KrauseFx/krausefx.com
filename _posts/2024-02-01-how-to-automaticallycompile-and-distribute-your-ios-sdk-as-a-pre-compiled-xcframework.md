## Introduction

In this technical article we go into the depths and best practices around

- Working efficiently on a commercial SDK in a larger team
- How to compile and distribute your iOS SDK as a pre-compiled xcframework automatically

## How to build and debug an iOS SDK?

At ContextSDK we have our whole iOS Swift codebase in a single local [CocoaPod](https://cocoapods.org/). This allows us to iterate quickly as a team, and have our SDK configuration defined in clean code in version control, instead of some plist Xcode settings.

**ContextSDK.podspec**
```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name             = 'ContextSDK'
  s.version          = '3.2.0'
  s.summary          = 'Introducing the most intelligent way to know when and how to monetize your user'
  s.swift_version    = '5.7'
  s.homepage         = 'https://contextsdk.com'
  s.author           = { 'KrauseFx' => 'felix@contextsdk.com' }
  s.ios.deployment_target = '14.0'

  # via https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoapods-packager/issues/216
  s.source = { :git => "file://#{File.expand_path("..", __FILE__)}" }

  s.pod_target_xcconfig = {
    "SWIFT_SERIALIZE_DEBUGGING_OPTIONS" => "NO",
    "OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS" => "-Xfrontend -no-serialize-debugging-options",
    "BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION" => "YES", # for swift Library Evolution
    "SWIFT_REFLECTION_METADATA_LEVEL" => "none", # to include less metadata in the resulting binary
  }

  s.frameworks = 'AVFoundation'
  s.public_header_files = 'Classes/**/*.h'
  s.source_files = Dir['Classes/**/*.{swift}']
  s.resource_bundles = { 'ContextSDK' => ['PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy'] }

  s.test_spec 'Tests' do |test_spec|
    test_spec.source_files = [
      'Tests/*.{swift}',
      'Tests/Resources/*.{plist}'
    ]

    test_spec.dependency 'Quick', '7.2.0'
    test_spec.dependency 'Nimble', '12.2.0'
  end
end
```

During development, we want to easily edit our codebase, run the Demo app, and debug using Xcode. To do that, our Demo app has a simple **Podfile** referencing our local CocoaPod:

```ruby
target 'ContextSDKDemo' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'ContextSDK', :path => '../ContextSDK', :testspecs => ['Tests'] 
end
```

Running `pod install` will then nicely setup your Xcode workspace, ready to run the local ContextSDK codebase:

Editing a ContextSDK source file (e.g. `Context.swift`) will then immediately be accessible and used by Xcode during the next compile. This makes development of SDKs extremely easy & efficient.

## How to compile a CocoaPod into a static binary (xcframework)?

The requirement for commercial SDKs is often that its source code isn’t accessible to its user. To do that, you need to pre-compile your SDK into an `.xcframework` static binary, which can then be used by your customers.

<!--more-->

Thanks to the excellent [cocoapods-pack](https://github.com/square/cocoapods-pack) project, started by [Dimitris](https://twitter.com/dnkoutso) by Square, it’s easily possible to compile your SDK for distribution to your customers. After installing the gem, you can use the following command:

```
bundle exec pod pack ../ContextSDK.podspec https://contextsdk.com --skip-validation
```

<img src="/assets/posts/context-sdk/sdk-compile-output.png">

Now open up the folder `./zips/ContextSDK/3.2.0/` and you will see a freshly prepared `ContextSDK.zip`. You can't distribute that zip file right-away, as it contains an additional subfolder called `ios`, which would break the distribution through CocoaPods when we tested it.

As part of our deployment pipeline, we run the following Ruby commands to remove the `ios` folder, and re-zip the file:

```ruby
puts "Preparing ContextSDK framework for release..."

sh("rm -rf zips")
sh("bundle exec pod pack ../ContextSDK.podspec https://contextsdk.com --skip-validation") || exit(1)
sh("rm -rf files")

# Important: we need to unzip the zip file, and then zip it again without having the "ios" toplevel folder
# which will break CocoaPods support, as CococaPods only looks inside the root folder, not iOS
zip_file_path = "zips/ContextSDK/#{@version_number}/ContextSDK.zip"
sh("unzip #{zip_file_path} -d zips/current")
sh("cd zips/current/ios && zip -r ../ContextSDK.zip ./*") # Now zip it again, but without the "ios" folder
return "zips/current/ContextSDK.zip"
```

`ContextSDK.zip` is now ready for distribution. If you unzip that file, you’ll see the `ContextSDK.xcframework` contained directly, which is what your users will add to their Xcode project, and will be picked up by CocoaPods.

## How to distribute your SDK?

### Manual Installation

There are no extra steps needed: the ZIP file you created above is everything that’s needed. Now you can provide the following instructions to your users:

1. Download the latest release: [URL to your ZIP file]
2. Drag & Drop the `ContextSDK.xcframework` folder into the Xcode file list
3. Go to your project settings, scroll down to `Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content`, add `ContextSDK.xcframework`, and select `Embed & Sign`

### Through CocoaPods

Distributing your pre-compiled .xcframework file through CocoaPods requires some extra steps. 

You need a second **ContextSDK.podspec** file, that will be available to the public. That podspec will only point to your pre-compiled binary, instead of your source code, therefore it’s safe to distribute to the public.

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name                = 'ContextSDK'
  s.version             = '3.2.0'
  s.homepage            = 'https://contextsdk.com'
  s.documentation_url   = 'https://docs.contextsdk.com'
  s.license             = { :type => 'Commercial' }
  s.author              = { 'ContextSDK' => 'support@contextsdk.com' }
  s.summary             = 'Introducing the most intelligent way to know when and how to monetize your use'

  s.platform            = :ios, '14.0'
  s.source              = { :http => '[URL to your ZIP file]' }

  s.xcconfig            = { 'FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS' => '"$(PODS_ROOT)/ContextSDK/**"' }
  s.frameworks          = 'AVFoundation'
  s.requires_arc        = true
  s.swift_version       = '5.7'
  s.module_name         = 'ContextSDK'

  s.preserve_paths      = 'ContextSDK.xcframework'
  s.vendored_frameworks = 'ContextSDK.xcframework'
end
```

Make both your podspec, and your ZIP file available to the public. Once complete, you can provide the following instructions to your users:

1. Add the following dependency to your `Podfile`:
```ruby
pod 'ContextSDK', podspec: '[URL to your public .podspec]'
```
2. Run `pod install`

### Through Swift Package Manager (SPM)
Create a new git repo (we called it `context-sdk-releases`), which will contain all your historic and current releases, as well as a newly created **Package.swift** file:

```swift
// swift-tools-version:5.4

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "ContextSDK",
    products: [
        .library(
            name: "ContextSDK",
            targets: ["ContextSDK"]),
    ],
    dependencies: [],
    targets: [
        .binaryTarget(
            name: "ContextSDK",
            path: "releases/ContextSDK.zip"
        )
    ]
)
```

You can use the same zip file we’ve created with SPM as well. Additionally, you’ll need to make use of git tags for releases, so that your customers can pinpoint a specific release. You can either make this repo public, or you’ll need to manually grant read permission to everyone who wants to use SPM.

To your users, you can provide the following instructions:

1. Add `https://github.com/context-sdk/context-sdk-releases` as dependency

## Conclusion

As we were building out our automated SDK distribution, we noticed there aren't a lot of guides online around how to best develop, build and distribute your SDK as a pre-compiled binary, so we hope this article helps you to get started.
